## Abstract
The increasing number of vehicles in college campuses has led to various issues such as traffic congestion, unauthorized vehicle access, and safety concerns. To address these challenges, we have developed a real-time parking monitoring system that allows for monitoring vehicle entry and exit, as well as identifying the types of vehicles present. This system incorporates a secure login page, a dynamic dashboard displaying real-time data, and a QR code scanner to streamline the monitoring process, thereby enhancing overall parking management.

## Introduction
With the rise in vehicle numbers on college campuses, effective monitoring and management of parking activities have become crucial. This project aims to develop a comprehensive real-time parking monitoring system that enhances the management of vehicle entry, exit, and identification of vehicle types. Our system is designed to provide a user-friendly interface while ensuring secure access and efficient data handling.

---

## Methodology
The system was developed using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies. The front-end utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for an intuitive interface, while the back-end employs PHP, MySQL, and WAMP server for robust data processing. Key features include:
- Secure login for administrators
- Real-time dashboard for vehicle management
- QR code scanning for quick student identification and data entry

## Literature Review
This project is supported by various literature that explores the implementation of web applications using WAMP server and QR code technologies. Notable references include:
- **"WAMP SERVER: A TECHNOLOGICAL TOOL FOR WEBSITE LOCAL HOSTING"** - Overview of WAMP setup and usage.
- **“QR Code based Smart Parking System”** - Discusses QR code applications in parking management.

## Results and Discussion
The login page and dashboard functionalities were rigorously tested, demonstrating high accuracy in user authentication and efficient data management. Users can easily enter vehicle details, manage current vehicles, and utilize the QR code scanner for quick data retrieval.
